9. Optimize the robustness of the code for automatically searching executable files for the worker
10. Optimize the performance of the worker setting page to verify the blender executable files
11. Optimize the manager's main page code and attribute management code

13. Optimize the restart logic of the server after the service is disconnected in the manager
14. Optimize the code for repeated definitions of attributes in the SceneImageItem in the manager
15. Remove the options related to manager preference settings center jump detection, the default heartbeat detection interval is 10s, and the maximum error retry is 3 times

17. Fixed bug in the path during AOV rendering when the manager is empty
18. Fixed bug in the local rendering path when the manager does not fill in the custom rendering path
19. Fixed bug in the message that the message does not display ip when the manager does not fill in the ip.
20. Fixed bug in the garbled code caused by non-English characters in the drop-down list of the new scenes in the manager
21. Fixed bug in the display of the worker that the rendering is still output after the worker cancels the rendering
22. Fixed bug in the duplicate output and repeated return commands that occurred when the rendering was cancelled

**0.3 2025.3.21** Important version

1. Network image rendering now supports sample subset rendering (where each worker performs a portion of the sampling, and the manager combines all parts to form the complete image, available only for scenes using Blender 4.4 and above with Cycles rendering engine, experimental!)
2. Local image and animation rendering support for AOV (Arbitrary Output Variables, multi-layer, and multi-pass rendering).
3. Network image and animation rendering support for AOV (only when the tile count is 1).
4. Network animation rendering with AOV supports checking and re-rendering missing frames.
5. Adjusted AOV output file formats to match Blender's output formats.
6. Supports rendering of specified view layers within scenes, defaulting to the first view layer of the scene.
7. Supports rendering of specified active cameras within scenes, defaulting to the timeline (AOV rendering is disabled when specifying a camera).
8. The scene list now includes a function bar for setting sample subset, specifying rendering view layers, setting active cameras for rendering, enabling batch multi-layer rendering, and enabling batch multi-pass rendering.
9. Supports checksum functionality; the checksums of the manager and workers must match for successful detection.
10. In the worker's GPU backend, it's now possible to specify Vulkan as the rendering backend (default is OpenGL, switch manually to Vulkan), recommended for use with Blender 4.4 and above.
11. Moved the add custom scene functionality to the collapsible section below the list.
12. Added real-time progress display for file pulling.
13. Removed MD5 verification when workers pull files; sync now no longer pulls files, and files are pulled every time a check is performed.
14. Improved feedback for errors encountered during network rendering.
15. Adjusted the cancel button icon.
16. Fixed a bug where animation rendering wouldn't actively end the render state if re-checking wasn't selected.
17. Fixed a bug where messages in CommandLine Mode were missing time and status.
18. Fixed a rendering error that occurred after changing the file format and saving the file.
19. Note: If using image formats without an Alpha channel, there are issues with tile merging, caused by a bug in Blender's compositor system; we look forward to the official fix for this bug!

---

**V0.25 2025.1.20**
